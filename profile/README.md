## Welcome to SF Digital 💻

🎯 Our aim is to build modern software that supports the world's leading families and wealth creators. We manage and protect their wealth across several geographies and generations.

📈 While the majority of our projects are closed-source, we have made the decision to expose some of our systems to the community, in order to help others create a seamless user experience for their users.

<!--

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
